## Introduction

This project, the "Advice Generator App," was developed as part of a Frontend Mentor assignment to enhance my skills in HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. The app provides an interactive interface that allows the user to generate random advice quotes, offering them with quick and insightful advices, which are fetched from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com).

## Built Using
